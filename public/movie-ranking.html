<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Punisher</h3>
<p>The punisher is one of my favourite childhood Action movies that I really loved to watch even unitll now,<br />
    it's about a man who's family got slayed unfaithfully, he got depressed then he prepared for revenge with no mercy.
<h4>Movie Rate according to my personal prefrence -- 9.3/10</h4>
</p>
<br />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>That movie I really loved because it's a SC-FI with some real and powerfull thoughts about The subconscious
    mind,<br />
    And how it works and about dreams and our amazing mind that god created and it's amazing how powerfull our brain
    is<br />
    And how they use The subconscious mind to steal information from other's.
<h4>Movie Rate according to my personal prefrence -- 9.1/10</h4>

<h3>The Irishman</h3>
<p>That's a very powerfull movie that you must watch, In the 1950s, truck driver Frank Sheeran gets involved with
    Russell Bufalino and his Pennsylvania crime family.<br />
    As Sheeran climbs the ranks to become a top hit man, he also goes to work for Jimmy Hoffa -- a powerful Teamster
    tied to organized crime.
<h4>Movie Rate according to my personal prefrence -- 8.8/10</h4>
